# Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to learn Ansible while also making convenient playbooks focused on setting up new development machines.

The initial effort will be to setup a personal machine to my liking. After some trial and error, I plan to create other playbooks for professional machines, as well.

Further, I would like to make them as OS-agnostic as possible. However, at the time of creating this repo, I am unsure of the feasibility of this given the differences in package managers.
